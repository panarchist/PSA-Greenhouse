# PSA-Greenhouse

This mod requires USI-LS and its prerequisites (specifically, ModuleManager).

USI-LS config format and references are GPL v3 attributed to Bob Palmer aka "RoverDude", who I thank profusely for the mod this mod builds on.

The moniker "Panarchist Space Alliance" and related branding is All Rights Reserved Matthew P. Picio.

License: GPL V3 (see license file) except for the Greenhouse model and textures, which can be considered public domain 
(Ref: http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/40366-habhub-and-other-strange-things/&page=8

"Every single model made/shared by me is this "public domain" thing, even is this not mentioned(I usually did it). I don't know how all this work with models made for not my own projects, I love this people but I didn't made any contracts and everythig is intended to be free to use for everyone. Not because I don't respect copyrights but this is way how I handle my own things.

So you can use this as quote if you need something.
